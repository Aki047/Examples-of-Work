     <h1>The Method</h1>
    
      <p>Sean very much believes that the way to make education interesting is to make it entertaining. In doing so, he’s able to present a gracious view of hard subjects. Narrative and history are not always the same thing, and by stripping away what we’ve been told and presenting what has been proven, Sean lives up to his credo- “Education through Entertainment.</p>
    
   <h1>The Technique</h1>
    
      <p>When people are entertained, people are engaged. When people are engaged, they retain more information. When people are engaged with someone who can demonstrate expertise and entertain, they become more educated and enjoyed their time doing so.<br><br>…and that’s the real point, isn’t it?

    <h1>The Master Minds of S&A Productions</h1>
    
      <p>S&A Productions is a Father and Son endeavor. It started with Aiden asking Sean “Why did that happen” and getting a long-winded explanation.</p>
    <p>Aiden was bored instantly. </p>
    
    <p>But as is the province of youth, the questions didn’t stop. Sean decided that if he could help Aiden understand the answer and have a good time doing it, Aiden retain his new understanding longer.  Sean took each question as an opportunity to not only entertain his son, but educate and engage with him as he grew up. As a result, Aiden asks difficult questions in his own history class, and is becoming a historical pr
         esenter in his own right. 

    <p>As Sean see’s things, this has given him an opportunity to bond with his son over the things they both love- History and Motorcycles.
